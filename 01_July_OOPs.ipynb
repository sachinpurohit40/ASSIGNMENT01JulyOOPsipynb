    "\n",
    "ans 1 =  The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, as in most programming languages, is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a way that promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability. OOP in Python is based on the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: Objects are instances of classes, and they represent real-world entities or concepts. Each object encapsulates both data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects. A class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that are common to all objects created from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (i.e., a class). It hides the internal details of how a class works, allowing you to interact with objects through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) based on an existing class (base class or superclass). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, and you can extend or override them to add or modify functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a generic way, promoting flexibility and extensibility."

    "que 2 = What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans 2 = In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a data structure or instance of a class. Everything in Python is treated as an object, including integers, strings, lists, functions, and user-defined classes. Objects in Python have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and Methods: An object combines data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions associated with the object). For example, a string object not only stores the characters of the string but also provides methods for string manipulation, such as upper(), lower(), and split().\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: An object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. You can create multiple objects (instances) from a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Attributes are variables that store data within an object. They can be accessed using dot notation, such as object.attribute. For example, if you have an object representing a person, you might have attributes like name, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Methods are functions associated with objects. They define the behavior or actions that an object can perform. You can call methods on an object using dot notation, such as object.method(). For example, you can call the append() method on a list object to add an element to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: Each object in Python has a unique identity, which can be obtained using the id() function. Two objects with the same data may have different identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type: Every object in Python has a type, which can be obtained using the type() function. The type represents the class to which the object belongs.\n",

    "    eg."
